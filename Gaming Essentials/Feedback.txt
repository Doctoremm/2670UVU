Was the forest area long enough?

Compared to the other objects you need to grab, yes. Perhaps an extra small puzzle might be nice. 

Did you know where to go and what to do?

For the most part, yes. It was pretty easy to tell when I couldn't enter an area, so I would go the other way.

Was it too hard or too easy?

Right in between. The temple was obviously the harder part of the game, but it wasn't tough necessarily, just mildly frustrating. ;)

Should there be more/less enemies?

I think the amount you had was great. Maybe if you added some enemies in forest area, it would make it longer.

Should there be more health options or power ups?

That part was great. :) Maybe a spped up power because there are areas that are longer (alligator are), but otherwise it was good.

Did you have fun?

Yerp!

Any comments, questions, suggestions, or rude remarks?

Only thing I can think of is the water/swamp areas becuase it was harder to jump in. 

Thanks so much for playing and giving feedback!!!

Was the forest the part at the beginning that goes to the left? I think it was, I might add something super uber simple at the beginning just to teach the principle of picking up and dropping the things


Did you know where to go and what to do?
It was a little bit confusing, and took me a while to figure out that it was those wafer steps that were allowing me to jump high..

Was it too hard or too easy?
It wasn't too hard or too easy, but I did get stuck several times, haha

Should there be more/less enemies?
I think the enemy amount was good. The enemy by the red/green puzzle killed me really fast.. I think this would be really hard if we had limited lives

Should there be more health options or power ups?
Were there any? I didn't notice those..

Did you have fun?
Yes, I did. 

Any comments, questions, suggestions, or rude remarks?
I just think it could use a little more player training at the beginning.. before you get to anything dangerous. For example, make it so the player cannot even start the journey until they demonstrate that they know certain mechanics.. 
with the wafer jumping, you could do something super obvious with it at first, like give them something to jump onto that is too high.. when they try that a couple times, have a wafer appear that lets them jump up there.. you know?
..The camera seems really far away from the player.
